# GoFiber Clean Fresh

GoFiber Clean Fresh is a base template for Go projects, structured using Clean Architecture principles with some modifications to suit organizational requirements and knowledge from previous projects (Node.js Express-based). This template integrates essential packages and comes with user management, authentication-related middleware, and role/permission management.

## Features / Technologies Used

- **GoFiber**: Web framework for building fast and scalable APIs.
- **GORM**: Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for MySQL database operations, utilizing GORM datatypes.
- **Air**: Live reload for Go applications during development.
- **Zap**: Fast, structured logging.
- **Validator V10**: Validation of incoming data for requests.
- **Gocron**: Job scheduling for recurring tasks.
- **Bluemonday**: HTML sanitizer for handling user-generated content securely.
- **Viper**: For configuration management, with support for environment variables and multiple file formats (YAML, JSON, etc.), including auto-reloading of configuration files.
- **Clean Architecture**: A layered approach to structure the codebase for maintainability and scalability.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sayyidinside/gofiber-clean-fresh.git
cd gofiber-clean-fresh
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and update the configuration as needed.

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
go mod tidy
```

4. **Run the application (with live reload):**

```bash
air
```

## User Management

- **Users**: Manage user accounts.
- **Roles**: Assign different roles to users.
- **Permissions**: Define and assign permissions to roles.

## Auth Middleware

The project includes JWT-based authentication, as well as role-based access control middleware. You can extend the authentication middleware as needed.
